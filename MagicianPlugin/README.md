# Magician
This project is a port of the [$1 Unistroke Recognizer](http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/uist-07.01.pdf) to Unreal Engine (C++). There are only 6 templates (star, triangle, circle, v, x, pigtail), but you can add your own both by exporting CSV tables and in training mode. The project used UE4 v4.26.
Also, source code has [protractor algorithm](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/protractor.pdf).

The article about the project is available [here](https://medium.com/@qerrant/gesture-recognizer-for-unreal-engine-24422d5868ba).
