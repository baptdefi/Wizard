Wizard is a game prototype.

You are a magician fighting against ghosts. You will need to cast spells to defeat them ! But a magician must be precise and skilled to manage to cast his spells. You will need to correctly draw the patterns for the right spell to come out your wand !

The idea behind the prototype is to add the wizard's gestures in the FPS gameplay.
